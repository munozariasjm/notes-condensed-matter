    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the electronic structure of atoms and molecules is fundamental to our grasp of solid-state physics and condensed matter. The Hartree-Fock (HF) method, a cornerstone of quantum chemistry, provides an approximate solution to the Schrödinger equation for many-electron systems. In this chapter, we will explore the basics of the Hartree-Fock method and develop an understanding of its significance and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Schrödinger Equation for Many-Electron Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The time-independent Schrödinger equation for a system with $N$ electrons and $M$ nuclei is given by:\n",

    "## The Hartree-Fock Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hartree-Fock method simplifies the many-electron problem by making some key approximations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation: It assumes that the motion of the nuclei is negligible compared to that of the electrons. This allows us to separate the electronic and nuclear wavefunctions, treating the nuclei as fixed point charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The independent-particle approximation: The HF method assumes that each electron moves independently in an average potential generated by the other electrons. This approximation simplifies the problem by reducing the many-body Schrödinger equation to a set of one-electron equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these approximations, we can write the HF wavefunction as an antisymmetrized product of $N$ single-electron wavefunctions, or spin-orbitals, called the Slater determinant:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2,\\ldots,\\\n",
    "\\mathbf{r}_N) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}}\n",
    "\\begin{vmatrix}\n",
    "\\phi_1(\\mathbf{r}_1) & \\phi_1(\\mathbf{r}_2) & \\cdots & \\phi_1(\\mathbf{r}_N) \\\\\n",

    "\\end{vmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r}_j)$ represents the spin-orbital of the $i$-th electron at position $\\mathbf{r}_j$. The antisymmetrization ensures that the wavefunction obeys the Pauli exclusion principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Hartree-Fock Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the optimal set of spin-orbitals, we need to minimize the energy expectation value, subject to the constraint that the spin-orbitals remain orthonormal. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we can derive the Hartree-Fock equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat{f}_i \\phi_i(\\mathbf{r}) = \\epsilon_i \\phi_i(\\mathbf{r})\n",

    "where $\\hat{f}_i$ is the Fock operator for electron $i$, $\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r})$ is the spin-orbital, and $\\epsilon_i$ is the orbital energy. The Fock operator consists of the one-electron Hamiltonian $\\hat{h}_i$ and the two-electron interaction terms:\n",
    "\n",

    "\\hat{f}_i = \\hat{h}_i + \\hat{v}_i^\\text{HF}\n",

    "\n",
    "The $\\hat{J}_j$ and $\\hat{K}_j$ operators are the Coulomb and exchange operators, respectively, representing the electron-electron interactions in the Hartree-Fock framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the Hartree-Fock equations, we use an iterative process called the self-consistent field (SCF) method. Here is a step-by-step outline of the SCF procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose an initial set of spin-orbitals and calculate the molecular integrals.\n",
    "2. Build the Fock matrix using the molecular integrals and the current spin-orbitals.\n",
    "3. Solve the Hartree-Fock equations to obtain new spin-orbitals and orbital energies.\n",
    "4. Check for convergence. If the energy and spin-orbitals have not converged, return to step 2 with the updated spin-orbitals. If converged, proceed to the next step.\n",
    "5. Calculate the total Hartree-Fock energy using the converged spin-orbitals and orbital energies:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E_\\text{HF} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\epsilon_i - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\left( \\langle ij | ij \\rangle - \\langle ij | ji \\rangle \\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\langle ij | ij \\rangle$ and $\\langle ij | ji \\rangle$ are the Coulomb and exchange integrals, respectively.\n",

    "However, some limitations of the Hartree-Fock method should be noted:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The HF method neglects electron correlation, which arises from the instantaneous interaction between electrons. This omission can lead to inaccurate energies, especially for systems with strong electron correlation effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The HF method is not size-consistent, meaning that the calculated energy of two non-interacting subsystems does not equal the sum of the energies of the individual subsystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations, various post-Hartree-Fock methods have been developed, such as Configuration Interaction (CI), Coupled-Cluster (CC), and Multi-Configuration Self-Consistent Field (MCSCF) methods. These methods introduce electron correlation effects and improve the accuracy of the results, albeit at a higher computational cost.\n"
