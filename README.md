This are some basic notes about the basics of condensed matter physics and some of the introductory concepts.

## Contents


Some of the topics covered are:

1. [Specific heat of solids](/notes/02.ipynb)
2. [Structure of Materials](/notes/03.ipynb)
3. [Hartree-Fock Method](/notes/04.ipynb)
4. [Phonons in a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice](/notes/05.ipynb)
5. [The k.p method](/notes/06.ipynb)
6. [The Kronig Penney Model](/notes/07.ipynb)
7. [Mean Field Theory and The Ising Model](/notes/final.ipynb)

While the notes are written in a Jupyter Notebook, they can be viewed directly in the browser by clicking on the links above. If you want to run the notebooks locally, you can clone the repository and run them in your own computer. To do so, you will need to have Python 3 and Julia.

The problem sets are placed [here](/problems).
